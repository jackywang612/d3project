WEB-BASED SYSTEM DIAGRAM

This project is for creating a web-based system diagramming UI.
The goal of this project is a test task and make a simple chart from mock API.

A mock API with the data structure used to generate the example can be found at http://private-9f3c8-angstrom.apiary-mock.com/system  (documentation: http://docs.angstrom.apiary.io/#)

it is easy to change that endpoint so we can point your UI to a different, but structurally similar, API.  

This other API will have different values so we can see how the diagram behaves with different levels and a different number of components in each level.
